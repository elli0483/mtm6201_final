Developing the hospital monitoring site was an interesting yet challenging to do. Initially, coming up with the idea for the site I was not sure what I wanted to do. I needed to create a platform that would allow healthcare professionals to efficiently monitor various aspects of their work, such as patient information, tasks, and statistics, all while ensuring it was accessible and user-friendly on both mobile and desktop devices.

The difficulty was finding the right balance between functionality and simplicity. I wanted the site to provide all the necessary features without overwhelming the user with too much information or complexity. This required careful consideration of the layout, navigation, and overall user experience.

To overcome this challenge, we spent time researching similar healthcare monitoring systems and gathering feedback from potential users. This helped me better understand their needs and preferences, which in turn helped the design decisions for the site.
